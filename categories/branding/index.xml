      <description>I love working with non-profits. They often have limited resources, but make up for it with passion and a clear vision. These kinds of constraints often produce the best results, as they force the design to be focused and effective.
King’s Cross Church is a church plant in San Francisco, CA. Being in a city known for decades for being on the forefront of technological innovation, they wanted something clean, simple, and straightforward.</description>
