      <description>LOJIC (The Louisville / Jefferson County Information Consortium) is a multi-agency partnership that builds and maintains a Geographic Information System to serve Louisville, KY, and the surrounding county. Or, in more plain language, they make maps and mapping services – for both digital and print.
I was tasked with redesigning their aging site. The goals and objectives? Make it look better. Ok, not the most specific set of constraints, but you make do with what you have.</description>

      <description>The Louisville/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) had an old site. Really old – Clinton is president, we are prepping for Y2K, and Napster is about to drop – old. Confession: I actually liked their old site. What it lacked in visual interest it made up for in obviousness. However, they needed a refresh to match a recent rebrand. Additionally, the site didn&amp;rsquo;t do a great job directing people where they needed to go when they needed help.</description>
