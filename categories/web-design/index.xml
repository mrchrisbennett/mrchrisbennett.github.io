      <description>Some of my work lives behind an NDA, or some other form of agreement that says I can&amp;rsquo;t show it to you. Bummer. So, in place of that work, here is a choose your own adventure of how some of that work may have gone.1
The Start You sit alone at your desk. You gaze into the radiating glow of your monitor, waiting for inspiration. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up. A feeling of unease creeps into your mind.</description>

      <description>1 In 1848, 44 Roman Catholic Trappist monks established the Abbey of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky. The Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance follow the Rule of St. Benedict – peace, work, and prayer. Supporting themselves through farming, the monks now sell homemade fruitcakes, fudge, and more. Despite having the best bourbon fudge around1, they needed help to make it a bit easier for their customers to buy more of it.</description>

      <description>LOJIC (The Louisville / Jefferson County Information Consortium) is a multi-agency partnership that builds and maintains a Geographic Information System to serve Louisville, KY, and the surrounding county. Or, in more plain language, they make maps and mapping services – both digital and print.
I was tasked with redesigning their aging site. The goals and objectives? Make it look better. Ok, not the most specific set of constraints, but you make do with what you have.</description>

      <description>The Louisville / Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) had an old site. Really old – Clinton is president, we are prepping for Y2K, and Napster is about to drop – old. Quick confession: I actually liked their old site. What it lacked in visual interest it made up for in obviousness. And, it had a Space Jam meets your public utility company vibe that is missing from the web these days.</description>
