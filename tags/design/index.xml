      <description>Some of my work lives behind an NDA, or some other form of agreement that says I can&amp;rsquo;t show it to you. Bummer. So, in place of that work, here is a choose your own adventure of how some of that work may have gone.1
The Start You sit alone at your desk. You gaze into the radiating glow of your monitor, waiting for inspiration. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up. A feeling of unease creeps into your mind.</description>

      <description>1 In 1848, 44 Roman Catholic Trappist monks established the Abbey of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky. The Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance follow the Rule of St. Benedict – peace, work, and prayer. Supporting themselves through farming, the monks now sell homemade fruitcakes, fudge, and more. Despite having the best bourbon fudge around1, they needed help to make it a bit easier for their customers to buy more of it.</description>

      <description>I teamed up with Mike Cosper to work on branding for a new non-profit media company he was starting, Harbor Media. Mike loves vintage audio gear and classic broadcasting branding, but the first thing his new organization was going to do was produce podcasts. The first challenge was how to combine the aesthetic of classic American broadcasting branding with the more recent medium of podcasting.
Inspiration Our initial inspiration came from the vintage logos of companies like RCA, NBC, and the National Radio Service Men&amp;rsquo;s Association:</description>

      <description>I love working with non-profits. They often have limited resources, but make up for it with passion, vision, and scrappiness. These kinds of constraints often produce the best results, as they force an expedient focus on no-nonsense, direct results. They don&amp;rsquo;t have time, or the money, to waste.
King’s Cross Church is a church plant in San Francisco, CA. Being in a city known for being at the forefront of technological innovation, they wanted something clean, simple, and straightforward.</description>
