      <description>The Louisville/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) had an old site. Really old – Clinton is president, we are prepping for Y2K, and Napster is about to drop – old. Confession: I actually liked their old site. What it lacked in visual interest it made up for in obviousness. However, they needed a refresh to match a recent rebrand. Additionally, the site didn&amp;rsquo;t do a great job directing people where they needed to go when they needed help.</description>

      <description>The Louisville/Jefferson County Information Consortium (LOJIC) is a multi-agency partnership that builds and maintains a Geographic Information System to serve Louisville, KY and the surrounding county.
The original MSD design, circa 2003.   -- Goals The primary goal was to make their site responsive.
What Worked One of the biggest priorities for the design was to streamline how users got help. The &amp;ldquo;We Can Help&amp;rdquo; section addressed this. Present on every page, users are able to get the most important information they need with ease.</description>
