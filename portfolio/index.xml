      <description>The Louisville/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) had an old site. Really old – Clinton is president, we are prepping for Y2K, and Napster is about to drop – old. Confession: I actually liked their old site. What it lacked in visual interest it made up for in obviousness. However, they needed a refresh to match a recent rebrand. Additionally, the site didn&amp;rsquo;t do a great job directing people where they needed to go when they needed help.</description>

      <description>I teamed up with Mike Cosper to work on branding for a new non-profit media company he was starting, Harbor Media. Mike loves vintage audio gear and classic broadcasting branding, but the first thing his new organization was going to do was produce podcasts. The first challenge was how to combine the aesthetic of classic American broadcasting branding with the more recent medium of podcasting.
Inspiration Our initial inspiration came from the vintage logos of companies like RCA, NBC, and the National Radio Service Men&amp;rsquo;s Association:</description>

      <description>The Louisville/Jefferson County Information Consortium (LOJIC) is a multi-agency partnership that builds and maintains a Geographic Information System to serve Louisville, KY and the surrounding county.
The original MSD design, circa 2003.   -- Goals The primary goal was to make their site responsive.
What Worked One of the biggest priorities for the design was to streamline how users got help. The &amp;ldquo;We Can Help&amp;rdquo; section addressed this. Present on every page, users are able to get the most important information they need with ease.</description>

      <description>I love working with non-profits. They often have limited resources, but make up for it with passion and a clear vision. These kinds of constraints often produce the best results, as they force the design to be focused and effective.
King’s Cross Church is a church plant in San Francisco, CA. Being in a city known for decades for being on the forefront of technological innovation, they wanted something clean, simple, and straightforward.</description>
