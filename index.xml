      <description>LOJIC (The Louisville / Jefferson County Information Consortium) is a multi-agency partnership that builds and maintains a Geographic Information System to serve Louisville, KY, and the surrounding county. Or, in more plain language, they make maps and mapping services – both digital and print.
I was tasked with redesigning their aging site. The goals and objectives? Make it look better. Ok, not the most specific set of constraints, but you make do with what you have.</description>

      <description>There is a gas station down the street from our home. The prices, according to national averages (at at the time of writing this), are average. Not too high, not too low. Just right. But every time I go to pump gas, I have to double check to make sure I select the correct grade, because someone decided to put the regular unleaded in the middle, unleaded plus on the left, and super unleaded on the right.</description>

      <description>The Louisville / Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) had an old site. Really old – Clinton is president, we are prepping for Y2K, and Napster is about to drop – old. Quick confession: I actually liked their old site. What it lacked in visual interest it made up for in obviousness. And, it had a Space Jam meets your public utility company vibe that is missing from the web these days.</description>

      <description>I teamed up with Mike Cosper to work on branding for a new non-profit media company he was starting, Harbor Media. Mike loves vintage audio gear and classic broadcasting branding, but the first thing his new organization was going to do was produce podcasts. The first challenge was how to combine the aesthetic of classic American broadcasting branding with the more recent medium of podcasting.
Inspiration Our initial inspiration came from the vintage logos of companies like RCA, NBC, and the National Radio Service Men&amp;rsquo;s Association:</description>

      <title>Progressively Enhancing CSS Grid: Floats and Pseudos and IE, Oh My!</title>

      <description>So you want to use CSS Grid, but you also need to support IE9, Opera Mini, and Blackberry Browser 10? No problem. With a few key things to keep in mind, progressively enhancing a design with CSS Grid is easy.
A Basic Item Grid Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to lay out a simple grid of items such as cards, tiles, or whatever you want to call them. Our HTML would look something like this:</description>

      <title>CSS Grid for Article Layout</title>
      <link>http://www.chrisbennett.io/posts/css-grid-article-layout/</link>

      <description>CSS Grid makes big-picture layout a breeze. Need a flexible-yet-robust grid for your design? Grid has you covered. But what about smaller to mid-sized layouts, such as the content of an article? Well, CSS Grid makes some things easier, such as full-width content that breaks out of the regular flow of the content. However, there are some minor caveats that, with some planning, are easily dealt with.
Basic Article Layout Laying out a basic article is straightforward enough.</description>

      <description>I love working with non-profits. They often have limited resources, but make up for it with passion, vision, and scrappiness. These kinds of constraints often produce the best results, as they force an expedient focus on no-nonsense, direct results. They don&amp;rsquo;t have time, or the money, to waste.
King’s Cross Church is a church plant in San Francisco, CA. Being in a city known for being at the forefront of technological innovation, they wanted something clean, simple, and straightforward.</description>
